CBL is playing 4D chess in the retail REIT game. Unlike the high majority retail REITS I’ve seen, it has non-recourse loans. What does that mean? It means that if a property isn’t pulling its weight, they just toss the keys back to the lender and walk away. To simplify:

1. CBL buys a property with loans (like a mortgage)
2. Property works out - CBL wins
3. Property doesn’t work out - CBL can simply walk away and the bank takes the property, but ***cannot go after other assets!*** CBL only loses what they put in (analogous to down payment... not a huge L)

This is combined with some excellent operational performance compared with peers. Depending on what comp you use, it seems like CBL could fairly be 2-3x higher in stock price. It has **better** operating metrics and ROIC:

*So, if it’s so great, who owns it?*

Well, there’s 64.5% insider ownership… this is insanely high so management and insiders like Oaktree (Howard Marks) think it looks good. But this has a side effect that is negative for exposure: it also makes the float low, so institutions can’t easily buy in. But to solve this problem, CBL is using its 17% cash flow yield to buy back shares. They've nuked 8% of the float in buybacks this past year which means there is significant upward buying pressure. 

So essentially, this company has emerged from distress having offloaded shitty properties, and is now printing cash, buying back shares, and bullying lenders. There are several catalysts on the near horizon:

1. Lowered interest rates are pure fuel for this company, so if the economy shows softness, which it has, rates will come down even more and help it.
2. The company recently has had great momentum (+10% in past month) and this indicates more and more interest.
3. New buybacks likely will be announced at next earnings in Feb

*Here’s what makes it especially interesting. As far as I can tell, sh-rts were fairly lazy and just thought:*

“Hmm, this is some random shopping mall REIT, hurr durr let’s sell it. Plus, it emerged from bankruptcy, it must have had bad performance… yep hurr durr” 

This has led to 16% SI which is very significant for this sector.

If you are generally concerned with this play, I would recommend considering a pair trade by shorting one of the other, lesser performing REITs, which should get rid of most sector risk. Then you sit around and wait. Management is insanely aligned with you, the company is on fire, and it’s going to get even better if rates lower. In the meantime, you enjoy cash being thrown off and shares being bought back.

💊MaraStrategy

For this section please humor me by assuming it is near impossible for $BTC to go down and it just continues going up. Think: 'sToNkS oNlY gO uP' type shit 😌

Thanks to the pioneers and investors in MicroStrategy an asymmetrical opportunity has presented itself. $MARA or Marathon Digital Holdings mines bitcoin and holds bitcoin, a shit-ton of it. In fact its the largest mining company by market cap with the largest $BTC holdings after $MSTR.

The ""MaraStrategy"" (codename: 💊) is an ambitious prospect of acquiring, holding and utilizing $BTC. Basically borrowing money against its holdings to buy $BTC and in turn providing that investment opportunity to its shareholders. $MSTR CEO Michael Saylor has derived this creative business model that is pushing both industry and the world at large into securing $BTC holdings. A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind, highly recommend listening to his vision for bitcoin from interviews on youtube.

$MARA happens to be in the best position to replicate what $MSTR is doing.  
\- They have plenty of expertise and experience within the sector.  
\- A forward thinking CEO (s/o Fred👋) who has already began executing the MicroStrategy model.  
\- One of the strongest mining operations.  
\- Fresh infrastructure investment prepped for halving.  
\- A growing reputation of HODLing $BTC.  

So why not just buy $MSTR? ""They were first!"" They will come out on top... right? Yes and no. They are currently utilizing their $BTC holdings better than anyone else. However, the $BTC value per share would be reduced if everyone just kept buying in, driving it higher as shares are diluted. $MSTR still has to pay their ""debts"" over time (which is crucial because $BTC takes time to go up \[I'm simplifying this slightly\]). Plus their option premiums are pricey 😤

We are starting to see other companies switching from purely fiat currency to diversified holdings with $BTC, daily.

To be clear I am not saying $MSTR is done running at all. My conviction is simply that $MARA presents an asymmetrical opportunity to get (fuck you) money from (irresponsible) option positions because it is an early adopter of the same strategy and is currently wildly undervalued by comparison 🤑

Hopefully you kept in mind what I said about $BTC not going down, it helps understand the premise.  
Also its true (facts no cap on god frfr), $BTC is just going to keep rising, its inevitable. Although if it has a big dipperino all this goes to shit... but its a bull market so we're throwing caution to the wind 🙃

Bitcoin's monetary value fluctuates, its use-cases expand but fundamentally its societal value is static and has remained intact since manifestation. No one knows what price $BTC is going to but I bet my dick it's much higher than 100k 🚀

Continued aggressive purchasing of $BTC, the sooner the better. Fred Theil needs to show he's committed to following the MaraStrategy model. Then he needs to utilize the holdings to purchase against for more $BTC and to expand operations because the main business needs to also benefit from the increased holding for shareholder value.

Investors flooding in from both retail and institutional have been a huge driving factor of bitcoins positive price action. It is easier to access bitcoin now because you don't have to directly buy $BTC, $MSTR, $IBIT and now $MARA give simple, cheap and liquid ways to diversify in $BTC as fiat currency loses some ""market share"" to Bitcoin.

Bitcoin commonly held by public companies/governments like the transition from paper to software it is undoubtedly going to be a critical investment in the future and holding out means losing out.

I am only going to go over $MARA compared to $MSTR, they have the most bitcoins and $MSTR is $MARA's biggest competitor. Numbers are from Nov 21st, assume a $BTC value of 98k. Premium calculations are taken from u/Jazzlike_Record_8915 on Reddit, they obviously fluctuate daily but I am just using them to illustrate a point.

While the value of $MSTR is derived 99% from its $BTC holdings essentially making it just a proxy, $MARA has an operational business valued at $3B so lets factor that in to calculate the premium paid per Bitcoin.

Holdings Value (Bitcoin):  
\- $MARA $3.191B - $MSTR $32.457B  
   
Gross Equity (Operating Company Value):  
\- $MARA $6.391B - $MSTR $32.957B

🤔 156k vs 477k per $BTC

Ahaaaaahh! Do you like paying a 3x higher premium? I mean that shits just gonna keep inflating but my boy Fred, over at Marathon Digital Holdings, he's putting his business to work.

Last report states $MARA mined 717 $BTC in Oct, thats > 23 a day and \~8.6k $BTC a year. If they didn't purchase a single bitcoin for a year their holding would still grow 20% from mining alone 🌱

Value wise there is no doubt $MARA > $MSTR.

📊Technical Analysis

The charts look fucking glorious, full on 🐂ish, every chart in the market is pointing to $BTC rising. I only know how to do bargain bin TA for short term moves, check this guy out for the yearly picture, hes a freaking 🧙‍♂️ at calling movement before it happens.

In his latest $MARA analysis he notes it to be incredibly bullish as it breaks above the current level ($24) toward $41 and if it can reach that it has a chance to really run ($100+), only 6 mins long and very thorough.

😮‍💨Conclusion

$MARA so hot right now 🥵

My apologies if the DD was a bit cooked, between the Twisted Teas and my self diagnosed ADHD, shit took a lot more time than I expected but it was worth it. If you want a better DD look at the $MSTR ones and apply the thesis, same same. Also I hand wrote this myself, no chatgpt, the least you could do is buy the stock or leave a fuckin' comment eh 🫵🧐

✊How to Play - Buy, Hold, Repeat.

In my dreams I have a plan, my conviction is that $MARA hits at least $120 in 2025, but I'm not stopping there.  
You can try swing trading this shit but the moves will happen fast and sometimes in the pre-market, I think B&H is better.

Plays ordered by highest profit potential:  
\- 💎Buy options now, make the maximum on degenerate bets, rinse, repeat, reinvest - 20x your portfolio.  
\- 💰Wait until $MARA starts deviating more from $MSTR and other mining companies, buy stock & 1 month out options and keep rolling profits into shares.  
\- 💵Buy stock now, take 25% out every time it doubles: $50, $75, $100, $125  
\- 🤡Wait until its too late.

Last report states $MARA mined 717 $BTC in Oct, thats > 23 a day and \~8.6k $BTC a year. If they didn't purchase a single bitcoin for a year their holding would still grow 20% from mining alone 🌱

Value wise there is no doubt $MARA > $MSTR.

📊Technical Analysis

The charts look fucking glorious, full on 🐂ish, every chart in the market is pointing to $BTC rising. I only know how to do bargain bin TA for short term moves, check this guy out for the yearly picture, hes a freaking 🧙‍♂️ at calling movement before it happens.

In his latest $MARA analysis he notes it to be incredibly bullish as it breaks above the current level ($24) toward $41 and if it can reach that it has a chance to really run ($100+), only 6 mins long and very thorough.

😮‍💨Conclusion

$MARA so hot right now 🥵

My apologies if the DD was a bit cooked, between the Twisted Teas and my self diagnosed ADHD, shit took a lot more time than I expected but it was worth it. If you want a better DD look at the $MSTR ones and apply the thesis, same same. Also I hand wrote this myself, no chatgpt, the least you could do is buy the stock or leave a fuckin' comment eh 🫵🧐

✊How to Play - Buy, Hold, Repeat.

In my dreams I have a plan, my conviction is that $MARA hits at least $120 in 2025, but I'm not stopping there.  
You can try swing trading this shit but the moves will happen fast and sometimes in the pre-market, I think B&H is better.

Plays ordered by highest profit potential:  
\- 💎Buy options now, make the maximum on degenerate bets, rinse, repeat, reinvest - 20x your portfolio.  
\- 💰Wait until $MARA starts deviating more from $MSTR and other mining companies, buy stock & 1 month out options and keep rolling profits into shares.  
\- 💵Buy stock now, take 25% out every time it doubles: $50, $75, $100, $125  
\- 🤡Wait until its too late.

Life is short, lets make enough money now so we can spend the rest of it on our terms, I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball",0.85,176,9872,9.9,0.4947429906542056,0.09741373678873676,0.49524304336804326,1,425.06988525390625,0,0,Good
