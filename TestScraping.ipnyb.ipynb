The sole purpose of blocking this merger was to preserve competition in the low-cost airline market. \\n\\n“As our complaint alleges, the merger of JetBlue and Spirit would result in higher fares and fewer choices for tens of millions of travelers, with the greatest impact felt by those who rely on what are known as ultra-low-cost carriers in order to fly,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “Companies in every industry should understand by now that this Justice Department will not hesitate to enforce our antitrust laws and protect American consumers.”\\n\\nMaybe, just maybe, this whole thing is a charade and Spirit Airlines has had this planned for a long, long time.

Well, my wife and I love to go and eat here, and we noticed an interesting trend. No matter if we were in Oklahoma, Texas, South Carolina, or anywhere else, Texas Roadhouse is literally packed from opening (which is around 4:30 PM most days) to 10 PM (I think) most nights. When I mean packed, people will be parking on the grass and everywhere.  \\n\\n\\nSeeing this, it made me start thinking, \"Is this a traded company?\" The answer? Yes. So I began to look at the fundamentals of cash, debt, profit, and more.  \\n\\n\\nThey have no debt, $200 million +/- in cash, a quarterly gross of around 16% +/-, nearly $7 million +/- in revenue per store, opening 30 new locations, and they also own Bubba\\'s 33s and Jaggers (never been there because we don\\'t have any near us). They were also up on net income by 33%, revenue by 13%, and up between 13-30% +/- on everything else.  \\n\\n\\nGo to Texas Roadhouse on any day of the week and see how busy they are. If they keep growing, making more money, and keeping their prices low (which they are notoriously cheap compared to anywhere else if you want a steak), I would not doubt if they acquire other businesses and grow to a $50 billion market cap.  \\n\\n\\nA competitor, which is Darden, is only a $19 billion +/- market cap, $200 million +/- in cash, but $1.3 billion +/- in long-term debt, and only $5.3 million +/- in per store revenue.  \\n']\n",

In fact, the fund has a 30% short position against it directly, which for an ETF is absolutely bonkers. Now I am not bullish on most of Cathies wild claims, however facts are facts. The call options are not pricing in the potentially huge move this ETF can make.\\n\\nI don't want this post to get political, I started a discussion on this topic a few days ago and it got banned by mods (my bad for that, wasn't intentional). Yet government funding whether right or wrong can help specific sectors and companies. I truthfully believe that this government (Love or hate them) is going to pump cure related companies.\\n\\nI don't want to go into too much detail as I wish to stay fully within WSB rules, yet every single person of power including trump, mush, vance and JFK Junior has preached they want the American healthcare to focus on Cure based research.\\n\\nYou can watch the Joe Rogan with Vance here > [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRyyTAs1XY8&t=500s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRyyTAs1XY8&t=500s)\\n\\nARKG is absolutely full of said names, and whether the elections are right or wrong (This is not an election post nor political) it's extremely likely that substantial sums of money flows to these names.\\n\\nYet that's just the starter, when names like NTLA, BEAM etc ran up post covid in 2021 they were nothing more than cash burning Biotechs with fancy titles and ridiculously ambitious goals. To cure diseases at their route cause and potentially cure an array of heredity diseases at birth.\\n\\nToday we are starting to witness these wild claims become a reality, as most have failed a few winners in the Space have survived, such as CRSP with FDA approval in the USA, UK and Europe for its Sickle Cell disease cure. NTLA is not far away from potentially have a cure worth $20bn whilst its enterprise value sits at a mere $600.\\n\\nSkip to the 7th Minute where this is discussed In detail: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdctk4YMCfE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdctk4YMCfE)\\n\\nThen you have names like RXRX which already have a cult following and a pipeline in Oncology worth potentially 10x the Current value of the company. Backed by NVDA and with the largest super computer in the biotech industry worldwide, the CEO even has 90% of his net worth inside the company.\\n\\nI have gone over all the holdings and checked the financial situation of each company, how much cash runway they have etc and so forth. When I take that into account, along with the rate cuts, the fact that most of the weighted names have huge potential and pipelines, large piles of cash and catalysts pending, this feels like a great arbitrage play.\\n\\nBiotech has done a whole lot of nothing in 5 years, ever since the first rate hike, even though AI continues to show signs of benefiting the industry. Cathie Wood has become one of the most hated and mocked fund managers of our time. Almost every name has a medium to high short float and the sector isn’t being priced as though a big move is coming, yet the individual holdings do.\\n\\nBelow are just a few of the big catalysts being released into year end:\\n\\n1. NTLA ATTR huge data update\\xa0\\n2. BEAM 101 data at ASH\\xa0\\n3. CRSP CTX-112 CAR-T data\\xa0\\n4. NTLA 2002 Phase 2 Data\\xa0\\n5. BEAM 201 Data at ASH\\xa0\\n6. BEAM NHP ESCAPE Data at ASH\\xa0\\n7. SANA Data Update\\xa0\\n\\nThe big one is this Saturday with NTLA, if the data is good it will likely push the whole sector into a bullish uptrend, as that cure alone is worth more than almost the entire sector.\\n\\nIf you don't understand Genomics take some time over the next few days and this weekend to grasp just how much value creation is at stake here. This is the kind of thing we dreamed about 20 Years ago, and it's finally starting to take place.\\n\\nEverybody is betting against this whole sector turning into a Zero, just as many names begin to not only fulfil their ideas but actually turn a revenue, and significant revenues at that.\\n\\nSo I'm long Jan calls and just looking what further dated options to pick up.\\n\\nThese are the top 10 weighted names In the ETF TWST, CRSP, RXRX, ADPT, CDNA, TEM, VCYT, IONS, NTLA, BEAM Incase you want to look them up individually.\\n\\nSee you in 4-6 weeks with another Banger or a loser haha.\"]\n",

While the company regularly participates in stock buybacks, it did not do so during the third quarter, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.\\n\\nDespite having over $325 billion in cash reserves, Buffett opted not to use that cash to buy back shares, suggesting that he believes the stock is too expensive.\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t Miss:\\n\\nThis Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L\\'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here\\'s how there\\'s a limited time opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share before closing date.\\n\\nThe global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\\n\\nBuffett\\'s approach to stock buybacks is straightforward: he only buys back shares when he considers them a \"bargain.\" According to Berkshire Hathaway\\'s regulatory filings, he looks for a stock price below the company\\'s intrinsic value – a conservative measure considering the long-term worth of Berkshire\\'s assets. Analysts believe the absence of buybacks sends a clear message to the market: Berkshire\\'s stock is overvalued at its current price.\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway\\'s Class A shares are trading around 1.6 times their book value, representing the company\\'s assets once debts are subtracted. In the past, Berkshire has avoided buybacks when the stock traded above 1.2 times its book value, but that guideline was dropped in 2018.\\n\\n\\nTrending: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don\\'t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\\n\\nBuffett\\'s conservative investment philosophy remains firm even with a more flexible policy. Robert Korajczyk, a finance professor at Northwestern\\'s Kellogg School of Management, explained to CNN, \"He\\'s been very clear that they would never buy back shares if they thought that the firm was overvalued.\"\\n\\nIn addition to ending its buyback streak, Berkshire increased its already significant cash holdings by selling stocks in the third quarter. Some analysts took this as a cautionary move due to concerns about the current market environment.\\n\\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\\n\\nNYU Stern School of Business professor Aswath Damodaran told CNN that Buffett\\'s decision to hold cash suggests Berkshire is taking a conservative stance, likely due to high stock prices. \"It\\'s a signal that they feel cautious about where the market is,\" Damodaran said. \"They\\'ve become cautious because they think the market is richly priced.\"\\n\\n\\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-breaks-6-streak-155338238.html']\n",

This article provides a summary of the past entanglements between the two, as well as the direction of the current stage of development.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the 2020 Softbank World Congress, Masayoshi Son and Jen-Hsun Huang had a round-the-counter conversation on ‘What's Next for AI’. Jen-Hsun Huang, sitting by the fire in his trademark leather jacket, talked about the value of bringing Arm into the fold, and Masayoshi didn't mince his words, saying that the elder Huang would reach the level of Steve Jobs in the next 10 years.\\n\\n\\n\\nFour years later, the 61-year-old Jen-Hsun Huang and the 67-year-old Masayoshi Son sat down together again, and the topic still revolves around AI, but their personal situation and their helms of Nvidia and SoftBank have changed. 4 years of vicissitudes, Nvidia's plan to buy Arm at a huge cost has been aborted, but it has become one of the highest flyers on the wind of AI. On the contrary, Masayoshi Son, after putting his main efforts into Arm, experienced a trough, and finally ushered in a reversal in 2023 with the east wind of AI, and the success of Arm's IPO greatly alleviated the pressure on Softbank's revenue.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn a different path, whether it's Jen-Hsun Huang or ambitious Masayoshi Son, they are all betting on AI, Nvidia is known as the ‘arms dealer in the AI era’, and all of them, from big companies to unicorns, rely on their high-performance GPUs to guarantee their arithmetic power; Arm announced in July this year that it has formally entered into the field of AI chips, and it plans to realise mass production in the autumn of next year.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo it was no surprise that AI was the theme of the dialogue, which began with a ‘brag’ from Jen-Hsun Huang, who praised Masayoshi Son as ‘the only entrepreneur and innovator in the world who chooses and partners with the winners in every generation of technological change’. They then focused on AI development in Japan.\"]\n",

A proper response will only make your personal case stronger.\\n\\nI challenge you . \\n\\n\\nSome  believe we’re seeing a repeat of 2021, when price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios seemed irrelevant and the market was overly optimistic. While the current market does have a feeling of a ridiculous bullish sentiment( caught, cough NVDIA ) , the macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from 2021.\\n\\nToday, things seem to once again be irrational, I agree to a certain limit . It’s difficult when  fan boys attempting to downplay the importance of valuation, P/E since they are ridiculously high, ratios still matter. \\n\\nHOWEVER.  Today is much more different then 2021 \\n\\nPlease  consider the broader context. For instance, the ongoing geopolitical tensions, including wars, have different implications now than in 2021. The Russia Ukrainian war was the only “invasion”  that did not see the market gain  some short time after.  Every other invasion was a buying opportunity.  Why ?\\n\\n\\nBack in 2021, the Federal Reserve was tightening monetary policy, which restrained the market’s ability to recover from geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This time, we are in a much more stable environment, characterized by a decrease in interested rates with a robust American economy,  the exact opposite of 2021  in fact we are entering the prospects of cease fires much more rapidly. The possibility of escalation before rapid deescalation is possible. This is a typical  Trump tactic  \\n\\nAt the top of the list is the Trump Trade and what Tom Lee would refer to as the spirit  animal . The market may be in a golden pocket. \\n\\nHow fast will this happen ? Look at 2017 - \\n\\nBy January 29th trump had signed the biggest one thus far ; \\n\\nExecutive Order 13771 —entitled \"Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs\"— was an executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on \\n\\nJanuary 30, 2017\\n\\nYou can bet that with 4 years remaining he will have an even bigger once by that date leaving you only 60’days to buy whatever wallsteets leaves you with . \\n\\nThis is why shorting the market is incredibly difficult . \\n\\n- trade wars are in other words increased business activities. No tariff is imposed without unleashing a furry of printing to help those affected by tariffs . A small percentage affected at the cost of billions printed - when they print cash you buy assets \\n- Strong job reports\\n- Declining interest rates\\n- Falling inflation\\n- Invasion signal a buying opportunity the Middle East tensions have had zero impacts. \\n- Rapid escalations and complete deescalation to the point where the underground war is completely ignored by media   \\n- Oil is nowhere near as impactful as it once  was in its golden days \\n - Emerging technological advancements related to AI and robotics- Let us be realistic that only few companies traded publicly that have more cash then entire countries are at the top of this . TSLA’s and PLTRS price targets are no longer unrealistic considering the macro eagle view of the entire market and socioeconomic trends. \\n\\nThese factors contribute to a sense of American economic exceptionalism. So, while it’s natural to be cautious, there are strong reasons to remain optimistic about stock market opportunities. \\n\\n\\nI believe that the risk of missing out on buying shares outweighs the risk of investing during market dips. Just like the major tech companies have invested heavily in areas like chips, they ultimately need to deliver profits. However, the real danger lies in not investing at all.\\n\\n\\nDon’t let fear hold you back from investing']\n",

      "['SPHR (Sphere Entertainment Co) just had earnings this AM. There was a decent stock sell off today from a non-event/subpar earnings, but I saw over 1.4 million in net call option flow come in today during this dip. I\\'ve referenced research done by a Stanford Professor tons of times in this post.   \\n  \\n**Four sources of confluence here:**  \\n  \\n**1. Unique fundamental case highlighted by the research noted below**  \\n**2. More than 1.4 Million in net call option flow (institution(s) are betting big)**  \\n**3. Price is sitting at a volume-based key support level on the 1D chart**  \\n**4. Insider Buys by the CEO at prices higher than now**\\n\\n**WTF is SPHR**  \\nSphere Entertainment Co. (SPHR) is a unique entertainment company that owns and operates innovative venues, most notably the Sphere in Las Vegas, a state-of-the-art immersive concert and event space designed for large-scale performances and experiences.  \\n  \\n**The Bull Case**  \\nUnlike traditional venues, Sphere owns 90%+ of its content, allowing it to keep most box office, concession, and ad revenue. Analysts may undervalue Sphere due to limited historical data, unconventional structure, and high operational leverage. The current market value might underestimate its potential. Key sources include live artist residencies, immersive experiences, corporate events, suite sales, and exterior ads.  A favorable MSGN loan renewal would enhance SPHR\\'s cash flow, enabling strategic investments in Sphere expansion, content creation, and high-profile residencies, thereby fueling growth without immediate financial strain.\\n\\n**The Bear Case**  \\nLimited events (16 concerts + UFC) impacted revenue potential; 25+ concerts per quarter needed for substantial profitability. U2 is not drawing large crowds, impacting anticipated revenue from residencies. Upcoming MSGN loan renewal decision is critical. If the renewal is unfavorable, SPHR’s financial flexibility could be at risk. The main risk remains in Sphere’s ability to scale events and navigate upcoming financing hurdles. Also it could keep continue a downtrend if this support doesn\\'t hold.

He also stated they will continue to sell branded GLP1 copy of ozempic, as well as Liraglutide compounded which will be off patent soon.  The key point here is:  HIMS will ALWAYS have some sort of GLP1 and the cross sell is accelerating, new customers are spending more and more on their subscriptions!\\n\\nThis means a double down on GLP1 with a caveat to dodge lawsuits.  Dark Pattern tactics will ensure they maintain and grow sales in weight loss category.\\n\\nFDA reconsidered removing the GLP1s from shortage in response to a compounder letter to FDA, decision will be next week but it's bullish that it was even taken seriously vs. big pharma's counter letters.  Most think this is going HIMS way.\\n\\nRFK and Trump admin is historically anti FDA reg (announced policy) and specifically, ANTI NOVO (RFKs tweets have been slamming NOVO's profits on GLP1 constantly).\\n\\nHIMS is projecting 90%+ growth in Q4...with now 2M users, 72% gross margin, and capturing 54% of all new telehealth customers...\\n\\nHIMS IS what Teledoc could have been if they had ever been profitable and didn't flush $25B down the toilet.\\n\\nHIMS is the future of telehealth.  This is AMAZON when they were just selling books.  The most operationally efficient platform (using AI to reduce cost of doctors with MedMatch) with the best customer experience.\\n\\nAs we reach escape velocity, price target is $60-100 EOY given the excellent macro environment, and this would only put HIMS at a pathetic 20B mkt cap or 10x PS ratio for a company that might be growing 100%+ rev. per year, with well over $2B rev next year...\\n\\nWe haven't even seen their reveal of testosterone replacement therapy yet, but adds being focused around low test means its coming.

You\\'ll note the absolute rockets around every time that there was a news story announcing PLTR going into a contract for the US govt, and just recently when they went into that deal with Anthropic and AWS. Honestly fucking hilarious that Anthropic has a mission statement about not using AI to enable harm to human beings as they do a deal with a defense contractor but I\\'m here to make money, not make moral judgements. They should probably change that page though. P  \\n  \\nPeople see \"defense contractor\" and proceed to fully regard the stock as much as one can be regarded here in WSB. Full regard, I must emphasize. The reason that defense contractors are so lucrative isn\\'t just because Uncle Sam has deep pockets.   Defense contractors are valuable for:\\n\\n* Resale value: I can take an M16, a Humvee, or an AK-47 and sell it to some guy in some country that I can\\'t pronounce, and he can go kill his nemesis with it. Is PLTR gonna resell their algorithms to General Butt-Naked? I seriously fucking doubt it.\\n* As above, emphasizing the black market aspect: The US military pays a premium on some completely ass hardware because they buy way too much of it to compensate for the fact that quite a bit of it is gonna fall off the back of a truck into that Yugoslavian terrorist cell.\\n* Long-term viability: I can kill you with a pistol made 100 years ago. A 20-year-old fighter jet is still a serious fucking problem for ground units. A 10 year old Humvee is still drivable and maintainable. But even a 2-year-old algorithm or model? The pace of software and model design is prohibitively expensive for the value you receive. You can\\'t sell a 10 year old program, or most of the time even use the motherfucker with modern software.\\n\\n  \\nAnd onto competition. Yes, right now PLTR has quite a lot of headway in the space of providing artificial intelligence leverage and data processing algorithms for intelligence communities, because that\\'s their Brand, which is to say, digital blood money. More power to you, because christ knows that anybody who made enough money very quickly quit giving a fuck about the way they did it. But the assumption that PLTR has a huge moat is just flat fucking wrong. All the algorithms they use to predict behavior, or patterns in communication, or whatever-the-fuck else? ... literally just the same shit that digital ad providers are running.\\n\\n  \\nYou notice in their Anthropic and AWS deal that AWS is a digital ad provider? PLTR is soon to be challenged by any company who thinks to generalize their ad-driving software for intelligence reasons. If you can predict the size of the cock ring I\\'m gonna buy, I can only assume you can predict my next act of terror by my google searches. Is PLTR using some data-driving secret sauce that nobody has heard of? I really fucking doubt it.\\n\\n  \\nPLTR is a good company that has mad great headway into their space. But they are not a 450% fair market valuation from fundamentals good. When people lose their hype for AI and it becomes just another industry revolution the way computers were, PLTR\\'s revenue is getting its head bounced off the concrete. It\\'s a matter of digital ad companies and improvement of code-assistant agents challenging what little moat PLTR has in the current market.\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m not gonna hold you that my PLTR puts are absolutely fucking menstrual right now, but I\\'m buying LEAP puts when my broke ass saves enough from the cubicle farm. Let me reiterate: PLTR is a good company, maybe even a great one, but their moat isn\\'t big enough for a 450% fair market valuation, and even if their moat were bigger, they don\\'t have the same inherent profitability that the other defense contractors do. You can\\'t steal a PLTR algorithm off a truck, or trade the quartermaster some smack for a few dozen rounds of data processing.']\n",

      "['Once upon a time, in the golden age of department stores, Kohl\\'s was the go-to destination for anyone seeking a reasonably priced blender, a pair of socks, and perhaps a lawn gnome—all in one trip. But alas, those days are fading faster than the color on a clearance-rack shirt after one wash. Let\\'s dive into the hilariously inevitable downfall of Kohl\\'s.\\n\\n**1. The Amazonian Elephant in the Room**\\n\\nIn a world where you can order a drone to deliver your toothpaste within two hours, Kohl\\'s seems as cutting-edge as dial-up internet. Amazon\\'s meteoric rise hasn\\'t just disrupted retail; it\\'s drop-kicked it into a new dimension. While Kohl\\'s has tried to cozy up to the giant by accepting Amazon returns in-store, it\\'s basically like inviting a lion into your living room because you have a mouse problem.\\n\\n**2. The \"Treasure Hunt\" Experience**\\n\\nKohl\\'s stores are designed with the aesthetic of a labyrinth meets garage sale. Shoppers are expected to embark on an epic quest worthy of Indiana Jones to find that one item they didn\\'t know they needed. In contrast, competitors like Target have streamlined, organized layouts that don\\'t require a compass and a flare gun to navigate. Perhaps Kohl\\'s is secretly training the next generation of explorers.\\n\\n**3. Coupon Chaos Theory**\\n\\nKohl\\'s is infamous for its mind-bending coupon strategies. With Kohl\\'s Cash, percentage discounts, and mystery savings scratch-offs, checking out feels like filing taxes. According to Retail Dive, consumers are increasingly seeking straightforward pricing. But why make things simple when you can turn shopping into a Sudoku puzzle?\\n\\n**4. Fashionably Outdated**\\n\\nWhile other fashion retailers sprint to offer the latest trends, Kohl\\'s appears showcasing styles that were all the rage when flip phones were cool. When was the last time you walked into Kohl\\'s and seriously thought, \"God damn, this is fire\" Kohl\\'s consistently presents a clothing line that can only be described as \"blah,\".\\n\\n**5. Stock Market Slapstick**\\n\\nKohl\\'s stock performance has been about as stable as a Jenga tower in an earthquake. Over the past five years, their stock price has seen significant declines. In September 2018 the stock was trading at near $80, now trading at a measly $18.  But wait, it gets juicier! The short interest in Kohl\\'s stock has been notably high, signaling that investors are betting on the company\\'s misfortune. It\\'s like the stock market equivalent of people lining up to watch a train wreck in slow motion. Over 30% of Kohl\\'s float was sold short. When a third of your investors are essentially rooting for your downfall, it\\'s a tad suspicious. \\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nUnless Kohl\\'s can reinvent itself faster than you can say \"super Saturday sale,\" it\\'s headed for the retail graveyard, right next to Blockbuster and those weird mall pet stores. But hey, at least they\\'ll have plenty of unsold inventory to keep them company.']\n",

And, CagriSema's side effects (tolerability) would be about the same as Wegovy and Zepbound.\\nIn addition, TD Cowen analyst Michael Nedelcovych has a Buy rating.

      "[\"Listen up everybody:\\n\\nYou’ve seen the buzz around Archer Aviation (ACHR), but this isn’t just another stock to gloss over. These guys are dead serious about bringing flying cars to reality, and I’m all in with a solid position (I’ll reveal it later). Here’s why this might be the last chance to jump on board before it really takes off:\\n\\n**Momentum is building up FAST**\\n\\nEven after days of strong gains, ACHR is still pushing higher today, showing no signs of slowing down. This isn’t the time to sit back, short sellers are getting sweaty, and if this momentum holds, we could be in for a serious breakout. This kind of setup doesn’t come along every day.\\n\\n**Major Partnership and Real Progress**\\n\\nLike I mentioned in my previous posts here, Archer isn’t just another startup in a garage. They’re partnered with **Japan Airlines, Sumitomo, and even the U.S. Air Force**, with heavyweights like **Stellantis and Boeing** backing them. FAA certification is in progress—they’re hitting real milestones, not just putting out press releases.\\n\\nAnd in a big step for international expansion, Archer just hired a leader based in Abu Dhabi to oversee development in the UAE. This new role is part of their strategic push to bring eVTOL to the Middle East and expand their footprint globally. With someone on the ground in Abu Dhabi, they’re clearly thinking big.\\n\\n**Trump's Freedom Cities and eVOLT Vision**\\n\\nWith Trump pushing for “**freedom cities**” and futuristic tech, including flying cars, we could see big moves toward eVTOL infrastructure. If the U.S. government starts backing this tech, Archer’s set to be at the front of the pack.\\n\\n**Strong Momentum & Interest from Big Players**\\n\\nWith major funds like Citadel and others taking positions on ACHR, this stock has some serious eyes on it. Retail interest is ramping up too, and if this momentum keeps building, we could see some exciting moves ahead. All the ingredients are here for something big, sitting on the sidelines might mean missing out.\\n\\n**TL;DR:** I’m in on ACHR with a position I’ll reveal down the line (or to mods if needed). With partnerships, certification, government backing potential, international expansion in the UAE, and pressure from short interest, this setup is primed. This could be one of those last-chance moments before it truly takes off.\\n\\n*(Not financial advice—do your own DD*)\"]\n",

I don’t follow any single analyst, nor do I pay attention to what others might predict or what the indicators on their charts might suggest. \\n\\nHere's my thesis in simple terms:\\n\\n1. Over the past year, the monthly chart shows the stock has been consolidating. \\n\\n2. The trend has been one of higher lows and higher highs. \\n\\n3. The lowest point during this period was around $14, with the peak reaching $34. \\n\\n4. The stock closed at approximately $19.25 last week and is currently trading at $22.73 in after-hours.\\n\\nIf the supply wall between $23 - $27 clears, the next logical target would be $34. Beyond that, we might see a significant short squeeze ignite.\\n\\nThis isn't gambling. It's about being positioned correctly based on chart analysis.\\n\\n➡️ Keep an eye on earnings!!\\n\\nIt’s also worth noting that while I focus on charts, you do want to be aware of the underlying wind that’s moving crypto stocks. While I wouldn't say there's a direct correlation, the greed or fear in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies can greatly affect the miners and thus, indirectly impact stocks related to crypto mining.\"]\n",

I’m still bullish, but was hoping to see more. Yet, the stock is up over 25% since then. I’ve been following the stock for over a year now, and my guess is that the high short interest has something to do with it—approx ~20% short interest. I’m guessing that since the earnings were not “catastrophic” that shorts are doing some covering. According to Fintel, very significant % of sales are short on a daily basis (ranges between 50% and 75% from what I can tell) so lack of real liquidity may be a reason why stock is so volatile?

      "[\"Let’s face it, prior to a month or two ago, it’s been pretty terrible for the Bitcoin mining industry. Across the board it almost all affected companies were down. RIOT in particular. \\n\\nBut here’s Why I’m Excited About This Stock. Some of which applies to Bitcoin mining in general. \\n\\n RIOT is on the move. The stock has surged to $12.64 this week with impressive trading volumes.\\n\\nKey Points:\\n\\n1. Massive Mining Infrastructure\\n\\nRIOT operates some of the largest bitcoin mining facilities in the world, including the Corsicana site (with 600MW still under construction) and Rockdale (700MW). While other miners like IREN are planning large-scale sites, RIOT's operations are already up and running, and they’re far ahead in terms of scale.\\n\\n2. Bitcoin Price Surge\\n\\nBitcoin is riding high, currently above $80,000 (and some analysts predict it could hit $100,000 by year-end). RIOT holds over 10,000 BTC, which means as bitcoin prices rise, so does RIOT’s asset base.\\n\\n3. Future Goals\\n\\nRIOT’s ambition to hit 100 EH/s by 2027 positions them as a leader in mining hash rate, further boosting their long-term potential.\\n\\n4. AI Potential\\n\\nWhat excites me even more is CEO Jason Les mentioning that RIOT is open to AI opportunities. With their massive mining facilities in Texas—close to key urban centers like Austin and Dallas, with access to cheap power and low latency—they’re perfectly positioned to pivot into AI workloads if the right deal comes along. The growing demand for GPUs in AI, paired with RIOT’s vast infrastructure, could make them a key player in this space as well. Jason has already mentioned they have received a lot of interest in this direction.\\n\\n5. Political & Market Factors\\n\\nWith Trump returning to office, there could be major benefits for U.S.-based miners. Increased support for domestic bitcoin mining and the likelihood of regulatory changes to ease production could propel bitcoin—and in turn, RIOT—to new highs. As bitcoin rises, so does RIOT's profitability.\\n\\nThe Big Picture:\\nI’m not claiming RIOT is the only player to watch, but they’re certainly one of the biggest and in a strong position. With bitcoin price potentially reaching $100,000 in the near future, we could see RIOT’s stock easily hit $20-$25 by the end of the year, and $50+ if the market conditions continue to favor them.\"]\n",

The costs continuously add up for traditional economies. \\n\\nWho is designing SMRS? Tons of people are attempting but it no longer matters. As of 2020, the company NuScale is the only company in the united states with an approved reactor design. Other companies attempting to design and theorize have already gained support from the private industry in most recent history Amazon did so. They are giving money to start ups who are 10+ YEARS behind NuScale in hopes of getting in early.\\n\\n  \\nNuScale has lost money year over year but have done amazing at cutting down on costs and bloat reducing their year over year expenses drastically. They have received government assistance already in 2014 (https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/doe-approves-award-carbon-free-power-project), to the tune of 1.4b USD from the DOE which means government relations have already been built. \\n\\nThey went to deploy and test the reactors by building a 12 module reactor but fear of extra costs and hitting deadlines drove off private investors causing a halt on the project. AND YET NuScale performed relatively well in sustaining its value for a startup that\\'s never made money. They continue to strive for a mid 2025 start to selling and commercializing their product to prove to the world it is safe and possible. I don\\'t really think I need to explain in depth how AI data super centers, mass surveillance, quantum computing, and the general virtualization of everything will continue to drive the demand for stable sustainable energy and how that relates to NuScale.\\n\\n  \\nYou may ask the following: \"How is this a small risk investment if you\\'re claiming such higher performance?\", \"How are you sure we are going to go nuclear? The coming administration in the US wont be favorable to renewables!\", \"How do you think even if we are it will happen on a short time span?\"\\n\\n  \\nI have answers. \\n\\n  \\nEven if NuScale goes tits up in debt, has no way of securing contracts, gets beat out my competitors (impossible lol), IT STILL HAS ITS APPROVED DESIGN. That is their (for lack of a better term) trump card. It is worth the 24$ alone depending on who scoops them up to finish the mission. This leads me into the second nuclear stock. To supply this industry uranium will be needed. The government has been looking for a domestic supplier of fuel grade uranium that is ready for enrichment. Sadly, the enrichment game is mostly private holdings can\\'t get in on that public goodness. But Uranium Energy Corp. has been making money moves, aquiring LIQUIDATABLE uranium and hodling it as hard as they can. Increasing mining, storage, and infrastructure capacities. They are ready for the next move. The united states is already trying to bid on BOTH A GenIII+ nuclear reactor(https://www.energy.gov/oced/generation-iii-small-modular-reactor-program), as well as a domestic supplier and enricher of fuel grade uranium(https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-four-contracts-boost-domestic-haleu-supply-and) <-- they have one for Low enriched as well.\\n\\nThe government is cheap and wants to save money. They have made a report investigating the savings made per killowat compared to the incentives given. They found they gave out 50+ billions and made jack shit return. They equated to do the same garbage return rate they\\'d only have to use 10 billion for the SMR tech coming out if they support the role out. \\n\\nEven with trump in office these stocks make sense to invest in for both hodling potential and short term options gamba. The government is already in favor of this, they will do whatever they need to change the public perception Hell, they don\\'t even care., They will executive order whatever they need.  The following are reasons a trump office will help nuclear.\\n\\nHe has already stated that he will slash 4 or however many regulations per passed regulation. This will benefit all industries regardless of how you feel about it on an emotional level. Furthermore he wants a stronger American offense and defense. Putting SMRs into most states after commercial shows its viability will make for an invasion insurance, solar flare insurance, EMP insurance, supernova insurance, etc. SMRs are off grid capable. They can provide direct power hence the stability for data centers. If the grid goes down SMR\\'s keep pumping. The steam they produce in the next generation will be more efficiently harvested for chemical manufacturing of ammonia and other reagents.\\n\\nEven with a strong want to continue using fossil fuels for trump, all the fossil fuel industries benefit. With the minimal space requirements needed essentially anywhere near any industry center a nuclear reactor could be built. And on the same page, lets talk about the building of this reactor(s) and its module(s).\\n\\n  \\nIt is a modular system and NuScale has already put thought and money into fabrication plants to create the modular components, as well as invested in what they call E2 centers across the globe to train professionals to work at NuScale reactor sites. They aren\\'t a tech bullshit startup with false promises they are actively confident and preparing for a 3 year explosion into the industry. They have made talks and contracts and centers in eastern europe namely romania, they have done the same in the middle east, they have done the same in africa specifically full blown university support from Ghana(https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ghana-signs-agreement-build-small-nuscale-nuclear-reactor-2024-08-29/). This shit is happening but retail regards still have their head in the sand. I think the big boys are waiting to blow this shit up over night in the coming few years.\\n\\n  \\nI bought in at 22 something and it hit almost 26 the other day. UEC is a bit more volatile but in the exact same boat. This isnt a source of uncorrelated returns, these markets are both going online. And if tariffs happen, these people are MOONING.

Alex Karp and Peter Thiel, both staunch capitalists who champion Western values and American exceptionalism, are key figures in this endeavor. Their interviews reflect their commitment to these principles.\\n\\nThe lack of a viable alternative to capitalism is evident; no other system has lifted more people out of poverty. From fascism to extreme socialism, alternative systems have historically failed. For instance, Mao’s socialist policies in China caused the deaths of over 20 million people, Stalin’s communism led to famine and political purges, and fascism has also proved disastrous. Despite its flaws, capitalism and democracy more precisely **republic democratic meritocracy** have shown more promise in advancing human progress than any other system.

      "['TLDR: Zuck is building an AI-powered money printer that makes JPow look amateur. They\\'re about to turn every pixel, photo, and IRL surface into perfectly targeted ad space. Positions: LEAPS + earnings lotto tickets because life is short.\\n\\nThe Story So Far\\n\\nYou beautiful regards remember when META crashed to $88 in 2022? When everyone thought Apple\\'s \"privacy\" changes and TikTok would kill Zuck? Instead, META got lean, mean, and is now setting up to absolutely dominate the AI era.\\n\\nWhy META\\'s About to Print More Money Than The Fed\\n\\nThe secret isn\\'t just that META has AI - everyone has AI now. It\\'s that META\\'s entire business is perfectly positioned to turn AI into cold hard cash immediately, not years from now.\\n\\nThink about it: META already has the best ad targeting in the game. They survived Apple\\'s privacy nuke because they have so much first-party data that they can still figure out exactly what you want to buy. Now they\\'re adding generative AI to create infinite variations of ads, test them in real-time, and scale the winners instantly. The more ads they test, the more data they get, the better it gets - it\\'s a feedback loop that literally can\\'t go tits up.\\n\\nBut here\\'s where it gets really juicy: META isn\\'t just using AI for ads. They\\'re testing AI-generated content in feeds, and word is the tests are absolutely crushing it. Every single piece of content - whether made by AI or humans - becomes potential ad space. See an influencer wearing a dope jacket? AI spots it, tags it, makes it purchasable. That random landscape in your feed? Might have been generated by AI specifically because you\\'re likely to buy what\\'s in it.\\n\\nAnd this is just the beginning. While everyone else is trying to figure out how to make money from AI, META\\'s already doing it. Their 8 million advertisers (mostly small businesses that live and die by META\\'s platform) are about to get access to god-tier ad creative tools. Nobody else has this combination of data, infrastructure, and direct path to monetization.\\n\\nThe Long Game Is Even Better:\\n\\nTheir AR prototype (Orion) is apparently insane, and with AI generating UI/UX on the fly, every real-world object becomes ad space. But here\\'s the thing: you don\\'t even need to believe in the AR/VR future to be bullish. The AI ad money printer works just fine without it.\\n\\nPositions and Price Action:\\n\\nLEAPS (2025/2026) are the obvious play here for maximum tendies with managed risk. Shares if you\\'re boring. And because I like to live dangerously, some 615c FDs for earnings tomorrow.\\n\\nRemember: This is a company that nuked their stock with the \"metaverse\" pivot, got bodied by Apple\\'s privacy changes, dealt with TikTok eating their lunch - and still came out stronger. Now they\\'re first in line to monetize AI at scale.']\n",
